              The inaugural SLC was initiated by a student leader named Aaron
              Beng, who was awarded the Presidentâ€™s Scholarship and Singapore
              Armed Forces Scholarship after he completed his A-levels, and was
              graced by Minister Lim Hng Kiang. The first SLC was held in 1994
              and it has evolved from a one-day local convention to the
              three-day international convention it is today.
