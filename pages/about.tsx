          The Student Leaders Convention (SLC) is an annual event organised by
          Hwa Chong Institution, and co-facilitated by Nanyang Girls' High
          School. The convention serves as an avenue for Delegates across the
          globe to come together and discuss pertinent issues in our world and
          communities. It is an open platform for Delegates to learn the
          different perspectives of other Delegates and gain insight into
          societal issues, empowering them with the confidence and strength to
          spark positive change at home.

          The first SLC was held in 1994 and it has evolved from a one-day local
          convention to the three-day international convention it is today. The
          inaugural SLC was initiated by a student leader named Aaron Beng, who
          was awarded the Presidentâ€™s Scholarship and Singapore Armed Forces
          Scholarship after he completed his A-levels, and was graced by
          Minister Lim Hng Kiang. Previous Delegates have also had the honour of
          conversing with political leaders such as Senior Minister of State Dr
          Janil Puthucheary, Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam,
          Former Minister Lim Swee Say, Former Minister for Health Mr George
          Yeo, Minister for Communications and Information Mrs Josephine Teo,
          and Senior Minister of State for Transport Mr Chee Hong Tat.
